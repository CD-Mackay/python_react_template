# React In a Flask
  Welcome to React In a Flask. This project is intended to be a template to build out new applications in a Flask React Stack. Two API routes are preconfigured, allowing access to user profiles as well as displaying time in a readable format. 

## Usage
  This application requires two terminals. Both terminals can be run out of the root directory.
    - To start the API, run `npm run start-backend`
    - The frontend can be initialized using the traditional `npm start` as provided by Create-React-App
